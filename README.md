This is where the AI's tactical magic happens. Using the Minimax algorithm, the AI calculates optimal moves to either win or block the player.

### How It Works:

1. **Decision Tree**: For each possible column drop, a decision tree is generated. Each level of this tree represents potential game states after subsequent moves by the player and AI.
2. **Evaluating Moves**: The algorithm assigns scores to potential moves, predicting outcomes to select the best strategy.
3. **Depth-Limited Search**: To keep gameplay smooth, we limit the search depth, balancing between performance and strategy.
